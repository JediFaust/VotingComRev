# Voting smart contract with Commit-Reveal pattern

Decentralized voting smart contract with voting deadline and minimum quorum support.
When voting, no one can see to who you voted, this is the main advantage that Commit-Reveal pattern provides
Even the owner of the contract can't perform malicious actions due to the logic of the contract

Tests, Deploying tasks and NatSpec comments will be provided soon...
